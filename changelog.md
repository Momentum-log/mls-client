### [version code: 1.0.0] - 2025-11-06 - Hero section and footer casing/styling

- Added: Homepage hero section matching product context
  - Bold headline with yellow highlight treatment
  - Subtitle and dual CTAs (Get a Quote, Learn more)
  - Three feature cards (Tracking, Quotes, International Shipping)
  - Uses existing `Container` and `Button` components and project color variables
- Changed: Default hero text color set to dark via `text-foreground` to match white background
- Changed: `components/layout/footer.tsx` styling updated to use CSS variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-brand-blue`) instead of raw Tailwind colors
- Fixed: Case-only rename warning from TypeScript by removing `components/layout/Footer.tsx` and keeping lowercase `components/layout/footer.tsx`; verified imports use lowercase path in `app/layout.tsx`
- Removed: Uppercase `components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- **Details**:
  - Case-only rename process for macOS/Windows (case-insensitive FS):
    - Use: `git mv -f Footer.tsx footer.tsx`
    - If TS keeps warning, restart TS server in VS Code and re-run `bunx tsc --noEmit`
    - Ensure imports match casing and `git status` shows the rename
